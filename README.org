* 1 Billion Row Challenge in zig
This was an attempt to do the billion row challenge in zig and use std. I wanted
to see if it is any better than it was six months ago.  A lot of optimizations
could be done and cut significant time from it.

The code is a little messy, but it was done in half a day and I'm tired.

The data files aren't included but the script to generate them is. You can get
some of the base data files from the original github:

* Optimizations
- [ ] The hash table is really slow
- [ ] dont iterate over the hashtable and just grab the arrays out of it
- [ ] sort in the original hashtable arrays
- [ ] pairwise merge in the threads recursivey
- [ ] turn the station names in some ints and direct hash them
